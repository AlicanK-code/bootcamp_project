      <h3>Alican Kaplan</h3>
      <p> I have some previous programming experience. For my A-levels I was coding in Python. 
	I have programmed in Java in Visual Studio Code prior to the bootcamp to see how I would find switching from programming languages.
	I would like to pursue a career within Computer Science but I'm currently not sure which area I would like to specialise in.  </p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: </h3> 
    <p>My first programming project in Java. I started with an image and then used loops
	to construct a background which illustrated a pattern of circles covering the sketch.
	I used randomness when colouring the circles. I also used interaction to create a 
	click counter to record the number of clicks on the sketch.
	I also incorporated if-else statements and loops to be able to allow the image to switch from up
	and down based on the users' mouse interactions. I also used keyboard inputs.

	<h3>Java Project 2022: </h3>
	<p> My second programming project in Java. I began with the city engine provided for this module and decided to work my way up. Making bodies,
	    adding movement and projectiles, incorporating different levels into my game and adding a GUI.
	    I've really enjoyed working with collisions during this project as it gave me a better understanding
	    of the distinguishment between different bodies.
